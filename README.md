# Welcome

This repository stores the source code and outputs for our article **Post link to Arxiv version of the article here**. To generate the outputs, open the `generate_outputs.R` file and run each line of code, one at a time. Note however that some of the files are rather large and can take a substantial amount of time to compute. 

The `Code` and `Data` folders contains all the code and data necessary to generate the `Outputs`, which we include to save people time from running the code themselves.
